I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 170 5 star reviews)!

I am recently retired after a 35 year career in advertising, and am now a full time host! I am married to David, my partner in in life, and all things real estate, and we have a wonderful daughter, Adria, who graduated from Northwestern University and is now thriving in NYC.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!
